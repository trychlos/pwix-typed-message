 *
 * Display the error message on the bottom of a edition (either modal or page) panel.
 * 
 * Error messages may be rather simple: just display a message on the bottom, color it in red, and disable the OK button. That's all.
 * But, when your dialog is a bit more complex, you have several panels or several tabs, some errors are expected to block the panel
 * validation and the recording of the item, but some others only alter its good behavior, which may be fixed later. So should only
 * be considered as warnings.
 * 
 * There may be several errors, and the user may want just see all of them, in order to decide himself which one will be first fixed.
 * So:
 *  - this component is just responsible to display the most recent pushed message
 *  - a companion component is able to display all current error/warning/infos messages.
 * 
 * Parms:
 *  - orderableStack: an object compliant with the OrderableStack.IOrderableStack interface
 *  - classes: classes to be added to the displayed message whatever be its type, defaulting to nothing
